# bamazon

## Description
This is an Amazon-like storefront application that uses Node.js and MySQL. It also uses the npm inquirer and mysql packages. The app is a command line Node app that has two interfaces: customer and manager.

### Bamazon Customer Interface
When using the app as a Bamazon customer, the user has the ability to view available items to purchase. The user will be prompted to enter the ITEM ID of the item that they would like to order in addition to the quantity. If the item is in stock, the order will be completed and the total cost will be calculated.
